# Game rules

- 1v1 matches, turn based.
- Fixed 11 by 11 square grid, where cells are the individual grid squares that may be controlled by a player.
- A player wins when their opponent's health reaches 0.
- Master cells (deep blue and red cells) represent their respective player. Basically, the blue team is you and the red team is your opponent.
- A player loses HP whenever their master cell takes damage.
- Players begin with 1 mana point each, and gain an additional one each turn until they reach a maximum of 9.
- Mana points can be used to spawn cells or cast spells.
- Cells can move or attack each turn, except the turn where they were spawned.
- Starting from their second turn, players lose 1 stamina point per turn. Once they arrive at 0 stamina, they enter the fatigue state and start taking damage at the beginning of each turn.
- Fatigue damage gradually increases over the turns, incremented by 1 (first 1 damage, then 2, 3, etc.).
- Spells are special actions that players may use directly from their action bar.
- Spells allow the player to restore their stamina (1 spell casting = 1 stamina point restored).
- Each spell can only be cast a fixed number of times during the match.

### Additional information

- Inactivity warnings pop up after a certain amount of time when the player did not perform any action (such as spawning a cell, or ending their turn for example) and eventually lead to the player's automatic loss if they do not participate in the game.
- Players can concede the game to their opponent at any time.
- English is the only supported language.
