"""
This package contains the game engine for the game. It is responsible for handling low level core mechanics, such as
cell actions, spells, and board manipulation.

Note that is does not handle any action validation logic, which is the responsibility
of the match handler and its internal services.

The game engine is designed to be independent of the rest of the application, allowing it to be easily tested and
integrated into different environments.
