# Server

- Production deployment checklist
  - Use another session storage system like redis instead of a file system
  - Check the request security and flask/socketio configuration (rate limiting, CORS, etc)
  - Write down documentation for the future
  - Add 3 readme files, one for the whole project, one for the client and one for the server

- FIX : Errors occuring during a match should end it

# Client

- FIX : Have spell cast animation tip override each other
